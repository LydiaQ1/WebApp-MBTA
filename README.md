## Project Overview
This project is about building a website that generates the nearest MBTA stop and whether that stop is wheelchair accessible when the user input a location. First, with the API keys we got from Mapquest, we constructed functions that would return the latitude and longitude of a given place utilizing the JSON-formatted data from Mapquest. Then in the following functions, using the API keys from MBTA, we got the nearest MBTA stop of a given place and the information about whether that stop is wheelchair accessible. Then we constructed codes that could present the functions above in a WebApp. In addition, we developed the layout and aesthetics of the website in the html files.

## Project Reflection
Throughout the process, both of our team members were able to collaborate and communicate with each other in a timely manner. We started the process early which gave us more time to solve issues and improve the design. For general issues, we would discuss with each other and try our best to resolve it by going through codes from our class and researching tutorials and explanations online. From this project, we learned a lot from the errors, the process of finding possible solutions improved our critical and creative thinking. We now know, for issues that have to do with the APIs or data itself, how can we creatively solve them through subtle modifications on the codes.

Our original plan was to sit down and work on the project together without splitting parts. Then we realized that it is more efficient to have a general plan about how the code should be structured first, and then have each person move forward on her assigned part of the work (assignment was made based on modules). By doing so, a lot of time would be saved from overlapped efforts. And for unexpected issues we were not able to solve even after discussion and research, we went to Professor Li who generously provided help and suggestions. Next time, we would have a more well-designed and detailed work agenda in advance.
